# R-U-Tracking-front-end
## The purpose of R-U-Tracking is to allow athletes to track their progress in their sport. At the moment R-U-Tracking is a service for swimmers and track runners. 

## The app allows you to create an account and log you performances in races as well as your daily workouts. It will then take the data from your races and enter them into a plot point graph where you'll be able to clearly see what kind of progress you have made during the year.
